    "This notebook is a practical introduction to the main Recommender System (RecSys) techniques. The objective of a RecSys is to recommend relevant items for users, based on their preference. Preference and relevance are subjective, and they are generally inferred by items users have consumed previously.\n",
    "The main RecSys techniques are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Collaborative Filtering: \n",
    "This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on a set of items, A is more likely to have B's opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Content-Based Filtering: \n",
    "This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the items users has previously consumed to model user's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hybrid methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective than pure approaches in some cases. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem.\n",
    "In this notebook, we use a dataset we've shared on Kaggle Datasets: Articles Sharing and Reading from CI&T Deskdrop.\n",
    "We will demonstrate how to implement Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering and Hybrid methods in Python, for the task of providing personalized recommendations to the users."

    "# cold start problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem\n",
    "Recommendation engines that run on collaborative filtering recommend each item (products advertised on your site) based on user actions. The more user actions an item has, the easier it is to tell which user would be interested in it and what other items are similar to it. As time progresses, the system will be able to give more and more accurate recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, however, brings a major contradiction and difficulty to classified sites and their recommendation engines. Even though the newest ads are actually the most relevant ones, a recommendation system has far less confidence in recommending them to your users than it has with older items, but it’s just simply not a good idea to let older ads dominate the recommendation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution\n",
    "Content-based filtering is the method that answers this question. Our system first uses the metadata of new products when creating recommendations, while visitor action is secondary for a certain period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can identify visitors who are only there to browse and those determined visitors who know what they are looking for. For example, if someone clicks on everything from phone cases to real estate within a short period of time, the system will assume she is only there for browsing and won’t use their click history for recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to investigating the cold start phenomenon, this is only the tip of the iceberg. Every recommendation solution has a different method to cope with it, and after getting over the rough cold start, the real work of the engine begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visitor cold start\n",
    "The user or visitor cold start simply means that a recommendation engine meets a new visitor for the first time. because there is no user history about her, the system doesn’t know the personal preferences of the user. Getting to know your visitors is crucial in creating a great user experience for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying visitors\n",
    "Visitors to your site will probably not register upon their very first arrival. It’s actually rather understandable, given the fact that most internet users have already signed up for numerous sites and don’t fancy the idea of going through yet another registration process just to have a look around. What’s more, classified ad sites usually don’t require visitors to be logged in. Your visitors don’t even need to have an account to contact the advertiser and then buy the advertised good. So, your users need to be identified by cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If visitors delete or block cookies, they will be identified as a brand new user each time they visit their favorite classified ads site. The classified site should try to give these users specific identifiers, like unique user IDs. If this cannot be solved, everything the recommendation engine learns about these users will be lost as soon as they leave the site.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, product-to-product recommendations will persist in any case, whether your users block cookies or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A never-ending story\n",
    "While it’s true that cold start mostly affects new visitors, we must not forget that a similar phenomenon can easily happen with returning users. We shall illustrate what we mean with the help of the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robert is looking for desks on your site. He’ll be interested in ads for desks for around a week, but after he finds the right one, he will move on. When he visits again in a month, he may be looking for lawn mowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the cold start problem exists all the time, as Robert (and any of your users) will always be interested in new and different things. At the start of each visit, the recommendation system does not know whether the user arrived with new ideas or if she is still looking for the earlier items. This is why it is important for the recommendation system to identify the user’s actual, active interest after the first few clicks. Also, note that certain topics of interest are more persistent than others. For example, collectibles (stamps, memorabilia, coins, books, etc.) exhibit a rather long interest span, compared to typical consumer goods like desks or lawn mowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple devices\n",
    "Even if users allow cookies in their browser, they can still experience the cold start. This can happen, for example, when they use someone else’s computer to browse, or simply if they have multiple devices. Classified sites cannot link their user history from their different devices if they don’t have an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution\n",
    "Recommendation systems have an efficient solution for the visitor cold start problem. Below are the most important types of information that help minimize or eliminate the cold start phase. With the exception of behavioral information, all of this data can be obtained from both new visitors and returning users."
