libraries
```{r}
#graph plotting packages.
library(data.table)

```

Reading the data into R and dropping Over18,EmployeeCount,EmployeeNumber,StandardHours because in these columns the data is either unique or the data is same for all the row in the table.
```{r}
hr<-fread("WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv",na.strings = "NA",stringsAsFactors = TRUE,drop = c("Over18","EmployeeCount","EmployeeNumber","StandardHours"))
```

Now seing the structure of the data to get some idea of type of data present in the data set.
```{r}
str(hr)
```
Now viewing  the summary of all numeric column of the data set.
```{r}
summary(hr)
```

```{r}
colnames(hr)
```
Now we are grouping the ages bases based on age groups.
20-belowe
20-30
30-40
40-50
50-60
so now we are dividing our analysis on different age group.
```{r}
hr[,Age:=as.factor( ifelse(
  Age <= 20 , '15-20',
    ifelse(Age >20  & Age <= 30,'20-30' ,
      ifelse(Age > 30  & Age <= 40, '30-40', 
          ifelse(Age >40 & Age <=50,'40-50','50-60')   )
    )
  )
)
]
```


```{r}
colnames(hr)
```


In our data we have some features "Education", "EnvironmentSatisfaction","JobInvolvement","JobLevel","JobSatisfaction","PerformanceRating","RelationshipSatisfaction","StockOptionLevel"," WorkLifeBalance" which are numeric but the sense they make is factors,so now converting those variable to factors.
```{r}
fact_columns<-c("Education", "EnvironmentSatisfaction","JobInvolvement","JobLevel","JobSatisfaction","PerformanceRating","RelationshipSatisfaction","StockOptionLevel","WorkLifeBalance")
hr<-as.data.frame(hr)
hr[fact_columns]<-lapply(hr[fact_columns], as.factor)
hr<-as.data.table(hr)
```

Analysis on age group.

Now we are comparing which age groups are travelling the most.
```{r}
ggplot(hr[,.N,by=list(Age,BusinessTravel,Gender)],aes(x=Age,y=N,fill=Gender))+geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.6,position = "dodge")+facet_grid(~BusinessTravel)+geom_text(aes(label=N), vjust=-0.3)+labs(x ="The Age Groups", y = "Number of Employee")
```


```{r}
salary_monthly_dep<-function(age,typeTravel){
x<-ggplot(hr[Age==age& BusinessTravel==typeTravel,.N,by=list(JobRole,JobSatisfaction,MonthlyIncome, Department)],aes(x=JobRole,y=MonthlyIncome,fill=JobRole))+geom_bar(stat="identity",width = 0.3) +facet_wrap(~Department,ncol = 1,scales = "free")
ggplotly(x)
}
```

```{r}
salary_monthly_dep("30-40","Travel_Rarely")
```

```{r}
#for movement
#transition_states(EnvironmentSatisfaction, .01, .001)+ease_aes('cubic-in-out')
#for plotting multiplot on one page 
#multiplot(p1, p2, p3, p4, cols=2)
```
Now finding the insights regarding employee turn over.
so we found few feature which are very important for employee turnover.
MonthlyIncome ,TotalWorkingYears,OverTime ,JobLevel 
JobRole ,Age, EnvironmentSatisfaction ,YearsAtCompany








what percentage of employees leaving the company.
```{r}
# Create test data.
dat = data.frame(count=c(10, 60, 30), category=c("A", "B", "C"))
 
# Add addition columns, needed for drawing with geom_rect.
dat$fraction = dat$count / sum(dat$count)
dat = dat[order(dat$fraction), ]
dat$ymax = cumsum(dat$fraction)
dat$ymin = c(0, head(dat$ymax, n=-1))
 
# Make the plot
p1 = ggplot(dat, aes(fill=category, ymax=ymax, ymin=ymin, xmax=4, xmin=3)) +
     geom_rect() +
     coord_polar(theta="y") +
     xlim(c(0, 4)) +
     theme(panel.grid=element_blank()) +
     theme(axis.text=element_blank()) +
     theme(axis.ticks=element_blank()) +
     annotate("text", x = 0, y = 0, label = "My Ring plot !") +
     labs(title="")

```
Now ploting the scatter plot for to see the relationship between the monthly income ,Total working years and the attrition rate.
```{r}
x<-ggplot(hr,aes(TotalWorkingYears,MonthlyIncome,color=JobLevel,shape=OverTime))+geom_point()+facet_wrap(~Attrition)+labs(x = "Total Working Years",y="Monthly_Income")
ggplotly(x)
```
As we see in the above graph that the employees who 's monthly income is less than 10000$ ,total working years in range 0-20 ,job level 1-3 are having the maximum attrition.

so now i am dividing my analysis into 2 parts as in  monthly_income less than 5000 and 5000-10000 different as different job level people are :-
1)analysis on employee who 's monthly income is less than 5000$
2)analysis on employee who 's monthly income is in between 5000$ - 10000$



Now doing analysis on the employees who 's salary is less than 5000$
Now we further dividing our analysis in to two parts total working years 
1) Less than 5
2) Between 5 to 10 yeras

Now I am going to view  job level of employee and wheather the employee is working over time ,of those employee 's who 's monthly income is less than 5000$ and total woking years is in the range 0-5 years.
```{r}
x<-ggplot(hr[MonthlyIncome<=5000 & TotalWorkingYears <= 5 & Attrition=="Yes",.N,by=list(JobLevel,OverTime,MonthlyIncome,TotalWorkingYears)],aes(TotalWorkingYears,MonthlyIncome,color=JobLevel))+geom_point()+facet_wrap(~OverTime)+labs(x = "Total Working Years",y="Monthly_Income")+labs(title = "Over Time",fill="Age Group")
ggplotly(x)
```
```{r}

```

so by seing the above graph we can infer that job level 1 and 2 employee 's who 's salary is less than  5000$ and the total working years is less than 5 have high probability of  leaving the company,their is no much difference of employee turnover in these employees

But if we see in more detail 1 year experience and job level 1 employee are leaving the most.

Now we are checking their Environment satisfaction rating ,job,roles,Age group.
```{r}
x<-ggplot(hr[MonthlyIncome <= 5000 & TotalWorkingYears <= 1 & JobLevel == 1  &Attrition=="Yes",.N,by=list(JobRole,EnvironmentSatisfaction,Age)],aes(x=JobRole,y=N,fill=Age))+geom_bar(stat="identity",width = 0.3) +facet_wrap(~EnvironmentSatisfaction ,ncol = 1,scales = "free")+coord_flip()+labs(title = "EnvironmentSatisfaction Rating (1-4)",y="The Number of Employees moving out of the company. ",fill="Age Group")
ggplotly(x)
```
By the above graph we can infer by job role that 

#1) research scientist 

There are total 12 employees where 

1) 3 have rated EnvironmentSatisfaction  Low ,3/12 = 25%
2) 1 have rated EnvironmentSatisfaction  High ,1/12 = 0.08%
3) 8 have rated EnvironmentSatisfaction  very High = 66%

At the age group of 30-40 the employee was not satisfied.At the age group of 15-20 the employee are very much satisfied with the Environment but still leaving the company.


so now we are going to find out why at age group of 15-20 ,who 's environment satisfaction is high and very high are still leaving the company.

The maximum monthly income of one year experience research Scientist by the historical data of the company  is : 2994
The minimum monthly income of one year experience research scientist by the historical data of the company  is : 1009

The maximum monthly income of  research Scientist by the historical data of the company  is :9724
The minimum monthly income of  research scientist by the historical data of the company  is :1009
```{r}

```


```{r}
x<-ggplot(hr[MonthlyIncome<=5000 & TotalWorkingYears == 1 &Attrition=="Yes"& (EnvironmentSatisfaction==3 | EnvironmentSatisfaction==4)&JobRole=="Research Scientist",.N,by=list(OverTime,MonthlyIncome,YearsAtCompany,WorkLifeBalance)],aes(YearsAtCompany,MonthlyIncome,fill= WorkLifeBalance ))+geom_point()+facet_wrap(~OverTime)+labs(x = "",y="Monthly_Income")+labs(title = "Over Time",x="years at the company",fill="Work Life Balance")
ggplotly(x)
```
The most of the employee who came to this post in this company are freshers and they got 1 year of experience in the current company.
The research scientist who are doing over time and getting the similar monthly income as the employee who are not doing over time are leaving the company.
their work life balance is good.


```{r}
x<-ggplot(hr[MonthlyIncome<=5000 & TotalWorkingYears == 1 &Attrition=="Yes"& (EnvironmentSatisfaction==3 | EnvironmentSatisfaction==4)&JobRole=="Research Scientist"&OverTime=="Yes",.N,by=list(BusinessTravel,StockOptionLevel ,DistanceFromHome ,YearsWithCurrManager,  JobInvolvement ,PercentSalaryHike,RelationshipSatisfaction, EducationField)],aes(PercentSalaryHike,RelationshipSatisfaction ,fill=  JobInvolvement  ))+geom_point()+facet_wrap(~EducationField)+labs(x = "PercentSalaryHike",y="RelationshipSatisfaction ")+labs(title = "EducationField",fill="JobInvolvement")
ggplotly(x)

```
The employees who are frequently travelling the bussiness trips are generally moving out of the company and their job involment is also medium.Their relationshipsatisfaction rating also is very low 

The minimum percentage hikes given to research scientist is : 11%
The maximum percentage hikes given to research scientist is : 25%

so the percentage hikes are also given good to these employees.

```{r}
hr[,{
   Total = .N 
  .SD[,list(Per=(.N/Total)*100,by=Attrition)]
}]
```












































```{r}
x<-ggplot(hr[MonthlyIncome <= 5000 & TotalWorkingYears <= 5 & (JobLevel == 2 |  JobLevel == 1)  &Attrition=="Yes",.N,by=list(JobRole,Department,Attrition,EnvironmentSatisfaction,Age)],aes(x=JobRole,y=N,fill=Age))+geom_bar(stat="identity",width = 0.3) +facet_wrap(~EnvironmentSatisfaction ,ncol = 1,scales = "free")+coord_flip()+labs(title = "EnvironmentSatisfaction Rating (1-4)",y="The Number of Employees moving out of the company. ",fill="Age Group")
ggplotly(x)
```
As we can see in the above graph we can infer that 
For the employee 's who 's monthly income is below 5000$ ,total working years is less than 5 ,we have only two job levels 

For job level 1 these are the job roles and department :
1:Laboratory Technician (Research & Development department)
2:Research Scientist (Research & Development department)
3:Sales Representative  (Sales department)
4:Human Resources  (Human Resources department)

For job level 2 these are the job roles and department :
1:Manufacturing Director (Research & Development department)
2:Sales Executive (Sales department)
3:Healthcare Representative  (Research & Development department)
4:Sales Representative  (Sales department)
5:Laboratory Technician (Research & Development department)

By seing the EnvironmentSatisfaction  rating of the employee who  are leaving the company we can infer that :

At Laboratory Technician job role we have very high number of employees turnover,their Environment satisfaction rating is low in all the age group 's of the employee.  






We can see from the above graph in job role of Sales Representative(Sales department),Research Scientist (Research & Development department),Laboratory Technician (Research & Development department) these employee are leaving the company in a larger scale as compare to the other job roles..

hr_encoded[, convert_to_character] <- hr[, lapply(.SD, as.numeric), .SDcols = convert_to_character]
```




Handling the high correlation betweeen independent variable
```{r}
hr_encoded <- one_hot(as.data.table(hr),dropUnusedLevels=TRUE)
hr_encoded<-hr_encoded[,-"Attrition_No"]
```


This graph shows the correlation with decreasing order.
```{r}
hr_encoded<-as.data.frame(hr_encoded)
# remove features which are not used for correlation analysis
training <- select(hr_encoded, -c(Attrition_Yes))

# calculate correlation coefficient of each feature with survival
feature <- names(training)

corrSurvived <- data.frame(feature = feature, coef = rep(NA, length(feature)))
for (iFeature in 1:length(feature)){
    corrSurvived$coef[iFeature] <- cor(training[, iFeature],hr_encoded$Attrition_Yes)
}
# sort by correlation coefficient
corrSurvivedOrder <- corrSurvived[order(corrSurvived$coef, decreasing = FALSE), ]

ggplot(corrSurvivedOrder, aes(x = factor(feature, levels = feature), y = coef,fill=coef)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    coord_flip() + 
    xlab("Feature") + 
    ylab("Correlation Coefficient")
```
correlation plot
```{r}
# function to calculate plot feature correlation matrix
getCorrMatrix <- function(featureList, showPlot = TRUE){
    # remove Survived from training set and order feature with respect to correlation coefficient to survived
    passengerCorr <- hr_encoded[, as.character(featureList)]
    # calculate correlation matrix
    corrMatrix <- cor(passengerCorr)
    # plot matrix
    if (showPlot) {corrplot(corrMatrix, method = "color", type = "upper")}
    corrMatrix
}

corrMatrix <- getCorrMatrix(rev(corrSurvivedOrder$feature))
```

```{r}
# function to get data frame with pairwise correlation of features
getPairCorrelation <- function(corrMatrix){
    featureName <- colnames(corrMatrix)
    nFeature <- length(featureName)
    
    # set lower triangle of matrix to NA (these values are all redundant)
    corrMatrix[lower.tri(corrMatrix, diag = TRUE)] <- NA
    
    # convert matrix to data frame
    featurePair <- data.frame(feature1 = rep(featureName, nFeature), feature2 = rep(featureName, each = nFeature), coef = as.vector(corrMatrix))
    # remove NAs
    featurePair <- featurePair[!is.na(featurePair$coef), ]
    # calculate absolute value of correlation coefficient
    featurePair$coefAbs <- abs(featurePair$coef)
    # order by coefficient
    featurePair <- featurePair[order(featurePair$coefAbs, decreasing = TRUE), ]
    
    featurePair
}    

featureCorr <- getPairCorrelation(corrMatrix) 
```

Lets have a look at the ten feature pairs with the highes correlations:
```{r}
kable(featureCorr[1:10, ]) %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```
```{r}
# plot histogram of correlation factors
ggplot(featureCorr, aes(coef)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) + xlab("Correlation Coefficient")

```
4 Feature Reduction

1)Greedy Elimination
```{r}
# features to be eliminated
nFeature <- length(corrSurvivedOrder$feature)
featureEliminate <- character(nFeature)

# data frame with all features 
featureRest <- featureCorr
featureRest$feature1 <- as.character(featureRest$feature1)
featureRest$feature2 <- as.character(featureRest$feature2)

# calculate absolute value of correlation coefficient with attrition
corrSurvived$coefAbs <- abs(corrSurvived$coef)

for (iFeature in 1:(nFeature - 1)){
    # get correlation coefficient to attrition
    coefAbs1 <- corrSurvived$coefAbs[corrSurvived$feature == featureRest$feature1[1]]
    coefAbs2 <- corrSurvived$coefAbs[corrSurvived$feature == featureRest$feature2[1]]
    
    # choose which feature has lower absolute correlation coefficient to attrition
    if (coefAbs1 <= coefAbs2) {
        # eliminate feature 1
        featureRemove <- featureRest$feature1[1]
        featureKeep <- featureRest$feature2[1]
    } else {
        # eliminate feature 2
        featureRemove <- featureRest$feature2[1]
        featureKeep <- featureRest$feature1[1]
    }
    
    # add selected feature to elimination list
    featureEliminate[iFeature] <- featureRemove
    
    # remove feature from featureRest
    featureRest <- featureRest[featureRest$feature1 != featureRemove & featureRest$feature2 != featureRemove, ]
}

# add last remaining feature to elimination list
featureEliminate[nFeature] <- featureKeep

# reverse elimination list
featureGE <- rev(featureEliminate)

featureGE
```

PCA for feature reduction
```{r}
trainingMatrix <- as.matrix(hr_encoded)
# execute PCA on training data
pcaTraining <- summary(prcomp(trainingMatrix, scale. = TRUE))
pcaTraining
# plot cummulated R2 with respect to number of components
#plotData <- data.frame(component = 1:nFeature, R2 = pcaTraining$importance[3, ])
```


















































































```{r}
y<-ggplot(hr[TotalWorkingYears > 0 & TotalWorkingYears < 10,.N,by=list(Attrition,OverTime)],aes(x=OverTime,y=N,fill=Attrition))+geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.2,position = "dodge")+geom_text(aes(label=N), vjust=-0.30)+labs(x ="overtime", y = "Number of Employee")+ylim(0,400)
ggplotly(y)
```
















The conclusion ,the most of the employees who have worked  0-5 years , their salary is less than 5000$,and are doing overtime and the job level 1 have higher probabilty of leaving the company.


JobRole ,Age, EnvironmentSatisfaction ,YearsAtCompany 
```{r}
x<-ggplot(hr,aes(YearsAtCompany,MonthlyIncome,color=EnvironmentSatisfaction,shape=Age))+geom_point()+facet_wrap(~Attrition)+labs(x = "Years At the Company",y="Monthly_Income")
ggplotly(x)
```
As we can see above that the employee of  age group 20-30,number of years in this company is less than 5  and monthly salary is belowe $5000 are leaving the company the most. 


Now we are knowe that at job level 1 the most of the employee 's are leaving.
so now i am going to check in job level 1 in which role the employees are leaving the most.

plotting the bar plot for the data representation.
```{r}
ggplot(hr[JobLevel==1 & MonthlyIncome<5000 &TotalWorkingYears<=5 &YearsAtCompany<5 & Age=="20-30",.N,by=list(JobRole,Attrition,Department)],aes(x=JobRole,y=N,fill=Department))+geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.2)+labs(x ="jobRole", y = "Number of employees")+facet_wrap(~Attrition)+coord_flip()+geom_text(aes(label=N), vjust=-0.2)
```
from this we can conclude that in job level 1,Age group is 20-30 ,monthly income is less than 5000$ ,totalworking years are less than 5 years,and years at company less than equal to 5 
In job level one There are three department
1)Human Resource
2)Research and development
3)sales.

In job level one we have 4 job roles in a Department :-
1)Laboratory Technician
2)Research Scientist
3)Sales Representative
4)Human Resources 

where the most of the employee 's are leaving in job role of Laboratory Technician of Research and development department and  Sales Representative Sales department.

MaritalStatus,WorkLifeBalance 
```{r}
x<-ggplot(hr,aes(WorkLifeBalance,MonthlyIncome ,color=MaritalStatus))+geom_point()+facet_wrap(~Attrition)+labs(x = "WorkLifeBalance",y="Monthly_Income")
ggplotly(x)

```
By this graph we can conclude that the employees who 's monthy income is less than 10000$ ,Marital status is single and worklife balance are Better are leaving the company.


```{r}

```
