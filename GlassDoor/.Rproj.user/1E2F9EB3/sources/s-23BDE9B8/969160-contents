libraryies used 
```{r}
#By this library we can get boston data set.
library(MASS)
#Library for the correlation plot.
#install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
#This library is used for sample.split function
library(caTools)
```

Seigng the data
```{r}
data(Boston)
Boston
```
Now we are finding the correlation between the variables as all the variable are numeric.
```{r}
#The cor function returns the matrix where the matrix contain the correlation values between each feature in the data set.
corr<-cor(Boston)
corr
```

Now we are ploting the correlation plot.
```{r}
corrplot(corr,type = "upper")
```
Now we are dividing our data into train and test data set.
```{r}
set.seed(2)
#first parameter is target variable.
#The second parameter is the percentage.
split<-sample.split(Boston$medv,SplitRatio = 0.7)
split
```

Dividing the data in to train and test data by subset function.
```{r}
train<-subset(Boston,split="True")
test<-subset(Boston,split="False")
```
Now we are building the model.
The lm()function is used to build the linear regression model.Its a Inbuild function no package is need.

```{r}
colnames(Boston)
```

```{r}
#we have two methods to create the models.
#Training the model method 1.
model<-lm(medv~.,data=train)

#Trainig the model method 2.
model<-lm(medv~ +crim+zn+indus+chas+nox+rm+age+dis+rad+tax+ptratio+black+lstat,data=train)

```

Now we are going to see the model describtion
```{r}
summary(model)
```
The main two things we see to check whether our model is good or bad by checking the number of stars ,the more number of stars means the p_value is way less than 0.05 ,if there is no star that means the P_value is way greater than 0.05 ,if there is "." means the p_value is slightly greater than 0.05.

The other important parameter we need to check is :
R-squard .

The R_square value should be near to 1 ,this means all the variation in the target variable is due to these predictors variables.

For the good model the R_Square value should to be near to 1.

Variation means pattern.

Now we are going to predict with our model and see the accuracy.
```{r}
predict<-predict(model,test)
predict
```
To comapre predict value and actual value we can use.
```{r}
plot(test$medv,type = "l",lty=1.8,col="green")
lines(predict,type="l",col="blue")
```
#diagnostic 
part if we get it know that model is just ok ok, we need to check these asumptions.
```{r}

```
