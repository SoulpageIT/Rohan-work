##Binary sentiment Analysis

###**Percentage of Sentiments in Employees Reviews**
```{r,echo=FALSE}
sentiment <- tidy %>%
    inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"))

t<-list(
  family="sans serif",
  size=14,
  color='black'
)


p <- sentiment %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  plot_ly(labels = ~sentiment, values = ~count) %>%
  add_pie(hole = 0.6) %>%
  layout(title ,  showlegend = T,font=t,
         xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE))

```


```{r,echo=FALSE}
p
```
As we see above that the 66.8% of sentiments are positive and 33.2% are negative.

Now we are going to see how positive and negative sentiments are varying by years.


```{r,echo=FALSE}
sentiment <- tidy %>%
    inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"))
theme_set(theme_bw())
#Alternatively
qq<-ggplotly(sentiment %>%
    count(date, date_total, sentiment) %>%
    filter(sentiment %in% c("positive", "negative"))%>%
    mutate(sentiment = as.factor(sentiment)) %>%
    #ggplot(aes(page, n / page_total, fill = sentiment)) +
     ggplot(aes(date, n / sum(n),fill=sentiment))+
    geom_area(position = "identity", alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(x = "Year",y="Relative Frequency",
         title = "Yearly Analysis of Sentiments of Employees",
         subtitle = "Using the nrc lexicon")+theme_bw()+
 scale_fill_manual(values=viridis_pal(option = "D")(6))+theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = -10,face = "bold",color = "black",size = 14))+
   scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
qq
```
As we see above that positive sentiments has a increasing trend from 2008 to 2012 ,there was a drastic decrease in trend of positive sentiments till 2014 and from 2014 to 2019 there was slight up 's and down 's in trends.

From 2008 to 2012 there was a high frequency of negative sentiments but after 2012 the number of negative sentments have  slight up 's and down 's in trend. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}

p<-GlassdoorPages %>%
    unnest_tokens(word, text)%>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"))
```

###**Word Cloud of Most Frequent Words**
```{r,echo=FALSE}
p%>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
 reshape2::acast(word ~ sentiment, value.var = "n", fill = 0) %>%
  comparison.cloud(colors = viridis_pal(option = "D")(2),
                   max.words = 100)
```
As we see the most frequent positive word used in the review is Helpful and most frequently negative word used in the review is hard.

Note:- In a word cloud, larger the word greater the occurrence of the word in reviews of the company. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
q<-sentiment %>%
    count(sentiment, word) %>%
    group_by(sentiment) %>%
    top_n(10) %>%
    ungroup %>%
    mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
   mutate(sentiment = as.factor(sentiment))  
```


###**Top 10 Most frequent words used in review for both the sentiments.**
```{r,echo=FALSE}
q%>%
    ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
    geom_col(alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
    coord_flip() +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
    facet_wrap(~sentiment,scales="free") +
   labs(y = "Total number of occurrences", x = "")+
#scale_fill_manual(values=viridis_pal(option = "D")(8))+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = -10,face = "bold",color = "black",size = 14))+
 scale_fill_viridis(end = 0.75, discrete=TRUE, direction = -1) +
        scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0.02,0))  +
  # strip horizontal  axis labels
        theme(axis.title.x=element_blank()) +
        theme(axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_blank())+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)
```


###Multiple sentiments Analysis

we have 6 different type sentiments:-

1)Fear.
2)Joy.
3)Negative.
4)Positive.
5)Sadness 
6)Trust


```{r,echo=FALSE}
sentiment <- tidy %>%
    inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))
```

###**Percentage of Sentiments in Employees Reviews**

```{r,echo=FALSE}
p <- sentiment %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  plot_ly(labels = ~sentiment, values = ~count) %>%
  add_pie(hole = 0.6) %>%
  layout(showlegend = T,
         xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE))
p
```
As we see above 38% of the words used in the review are positive which is the majority as compared to the other sentiment.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
sentiment <- tidy %>%
    inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))
```


```{r,echo=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_bw())
#Alternatively
ggplotly(sentiment %>%
    count(date, date_total, sentiment) %>%
    filter(sentiment %in% c("positive", "negative", 
                            "joy", "trust","fear","sadness"))%>%
    mutate(sentiment = as.factor(sentiment)) %>%
    #ggplot(aes(page, n / page_total, fill = sentiment)) +
     ggplot(aes(date, n / sum(n),fill=sentiment))+
    geom_area(position = "identity", alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(x = "Year",y="Relative Frequency",
         title = "Yearly Analysis of Sentiments of Employees",
         subtitle = "Using the nrc lexicon")+theme_bw()+
 scale_fill_manual(values=viridis_pal(option = "D")(6))+theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = -10,face = "bold",color = "black",size = 14))+
   scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent))
```

we have found a cyclic trend in positive, as from 2008 to 2011 there was a decrease, in between 2012 and 2016 there was a drastic increase, and again from 2017 to 2019, there was a downtrend in the relative frequency of the positive sentiments in the reviews.
The similar trend we found in joy sentiments also but the frequency of the sentiments are low as compare to the positive sentiments.

We found more trust level (sentiment) than fear sentiment and negative emotions is more than sadness among the employees.

we have found the cyclic trend in all type of sentiments present in the Employees review.


```{r,echo=FALSE}
p<-GlassdoorPages %>%
    unnest_tokens(word, text)%>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE)

```

###**Word Cloud of Most Frequent Words**

```{r,echo=FALSE}
p%>%
filter(sentiment %in% c("negative","positive","joy","sadness"))%>%
reshape2::acast(word ~ sentiment, value.var = "n", fill = 0)%>% 
comparison.cloud(colors = viridis_pal(option = "D")(4),
                  max.words = 200)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
p<-sentiment %>%
    count(sentiment, word) %>%
    filter(sentiment %in% c("positive", "negative", 
                            "joy", "trust","fear","sadness")) %>%
    group_by(sentiment) %>%
    top_n(10) %>%
    ungroup %>%
    mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
   mutate(sentiment = as.factor(sentiment)) 
  
    
```


###**The Top 10 most frequent words in each sentiments in Review**
```{r,echo=FALSE}
p %>%
    ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
    geom_bar(alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE,stat = "identity") +
    coord_flip() +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
    facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free") +
   labs(y = "Total number of occurrences", x = "Words")+theme_bw()+
scale_fill_manual(values=viridis_pal(option = "D")(6))
```
so as we can see helpful is present in positive, joy and trust, so it is most occurred word in the positive sentiment in the above Binary sentiment Analysis.

###**Conclusion**

From the analysis we come to the conclusion that Most of the Employees Reviews in Glassdoor of Northwestern Mutual are positive.
